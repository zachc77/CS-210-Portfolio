# CS-210-Portfolio

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

THis project was an investment claculator that shows how money grows over time. It allows users to enter values and see their balances with and without monthly deposits. The program helps with investment growth.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did a good job keeping code organized and easy to read by using seperate files and clear functions. The output is clean and easy for the user to understand.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think input validation. This would make the program better and prevent issues from incorrect inputs.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part was handling the claculations and formatting the output correctly.  I worked through this by testing the program often and finding issues as they came up.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

This project helped strengthen my c++ skills as well as working with multiple files, working with functions, and working with classes. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Using clear naming and seperating the logic into different files this makes the program eaiser to maintain and update later on.
